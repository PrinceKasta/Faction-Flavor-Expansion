# Faction-Flavor-Expansion
 A mod for the game "Rimworld" that aims to add to the faction system.
 
 Faction History:
	Generates each faction's past events and from the decides if the faction is aggressive or peaceful in a value called disposition.
 
 Faction War:
 
	-Each faction has a resource pool that is generated from its settlements count, their disposition and their tech level.
	
	-The resource pool of a faction is depleted when a pawn belonging to it dies, a settlement is destroyed or through war events.
	
	-Every faction can go to war with another. The war ends when either faction in the war hits 0 resources with three outcomes.
		1. White peace, the war just ends and both get a bonus to revitalize their resource pool.
		2. The losing faction is broken down to several smaller ones.
		3. Total defeat, the winner absorbs the loser gaining all their settlements.
		
		
Vassals and Tributaries:

	- Vassal: The player can force faction with low resource pool to become a vassal, the player can then demand resources every few days and will receive a payment at the first day of th year.
	
	- Tributaries: A tributary is like a vassal will pay monthly instead of yearly but won't agree to hand over rare resource for free.
